Tasks Completed (1-5) ✅
Task 1: Problem definition, goals, and KPIs
Task 2: Data collection and AI model design
Task 3 & 4: Requirements (mentioned in Trello), Agile/GitHub setup
Task 5: Implementation started, testing planned (but not implemented)
What You Still Need to Do:
TASK 5: Testing (INCOMPLETE) 🔴
You described tests but haven't implemented them. You need:

5+ unit tests (e.g., test embedding generation, image upload, vector search, metadata retrieval, LLM prompt formatting)
3+ integration tests (e.g., end-to-end pipeline, UI to retrieval, retrieval to LLM)
Automated test framework (pytest)
Tests must run automatically and be demonstrated
TASK 6: Distributed Architecture (NOT STARTED) 🔴
Currently, everything runs in one app.py file. You must create:

Interface Server - handles UI, user requests, error checking, data storage
Should NOT call AI directly
Sends requests to orchestrator
AI Server(s) - handles embedding generation, vector search, LLM calls
Orchestrator - intermediates between interface and AI (use RabbitMQ, database queue, or similar)
1-page preliminary report documenting the distributed architecture
TASK 7: Finalization & Final Report (NOT STARTED) 🔴
You need to:

Code cleanup: Document all code, ensure everything works
Testing: Run all tests, ensure they pass
Git: Commit everything to master branch
Requirements: Update SRS document to match final implementation
AI Models: Ensure latest versions, working APIs
Value Sensitive Design: Write 0.5 page on VSD principles
Environmental Impact: Write 0.5 page on carbon footprint (AI + non-AI)
Teamwork: Write 0.5 page on roles, challenges, team effort
Final Report: Concatenate all task reports (1-7) + new sections above
Missing Deliverables:
SRS Document (Task 3) - No evidence of this in your repo
Test files (Task 5) - Not implemented
Distributed system (Task 6) - Current app is monolithic
Final comprehensive report (Task 7)
Priority Order:
Implement automated tests (Task 5 completion)
Create SRS document if missing (Task 3)
Refactor into distributed architecture (Task 6)
Write final report sections (Task 7)
Code cleanup and documentation
Ensure all commits are in master branch
Would you like me to help you start with any specific task? I recommend beginning with the automated tests since they're fundamental to the remaining work.
